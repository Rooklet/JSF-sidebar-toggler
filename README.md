# How to hide JS Fiddle sidebar:
If your JS Fiddle sidebar gets messy you can just hide it. To achieve it just go to
(http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Rooklet/JSF-sidebar-toggler/blob/master/bookmarklet.html), 
drag JSFsidebarToggler link to bookmarks bar, and run it after JS Fiddle loads.

It will add toggler-button to navbar.

I use to generate bookmarklets by https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/ but you can also generate
bookmarklet from script by yourself.

If my stuff does not work, or JSF provide their own button, feel free to ping me.
